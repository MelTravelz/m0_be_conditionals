# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel mostly confident with the comparison operators. I do have to think for a minute to remember 'not equal to' (!=).

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Yes, the logical operators I completely understand...I suppose the most challening part is starting to memorize the names of everything. For example: logic operator vs comparison operator.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I feel mostly comfortable with these right now. I'm concerned I'll start to get confused when I see other peoples ways of solving the logic adn writing the code...but I'm hoping it will open up my mind to new ways of coming to solutions. Plus, I think the best part is that I find these if statments really fun to do, which keeps me motivated to solve the problem!

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
This took me twice as long because I got stuck on the first page of tasks (comparisons.rb). I understood the coding part/logic but not where to put it and how to run it: VS Code or Terminal or Replit. I had missed the part in one of our lessons where we learned to run a file in Terminal that we had changed in VS Code by simply typing 'ruby comparisons.rb' into Terminal. Anyways, I asked my small group and got an answer...and then everything else took maybe 30-40 minutes. 

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to finishe the other three tasks for the day and meet for a pairing session. I'm actually quite behind as it's now 2:15pm...but I've already adjusted my calendar and will get it done. :) 

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
The quesiton I most often have is: where to I type/enter/put this? But today was a good practice in reaching out to my small group. I wonder if there's a way to make Slack *ding* when we get a new DM?
